# frontend_recreations

This is a project I've wanted to start for a while. I will find sites I like (or don't) and recreate them to the best of my abilities, then improve on them as I see it. Inspiration from Youtube channel Hyperplex, who does a similar thing.

I've decided to do this project as I believe my skillset lies in frontend development, and this project will be a good way of expanding on that whilst learning other things I'm not fully comfortable with yet. Therefore I have decided to create this project in React, Typescript, it will be fully tested using Jest and Cypress. I'm sure there will be some minor backend functionality and some interactive elements. So all in all it should be a gfood all round project.

10/8 - Today I managed to get the functionality of page swaps from restyle/recreate when a button is pressed. I learnt about operators and cemented some more knowledge about use states

11/8 - Started styling the homepage. I wanted to add a couple more display cards so I can style them, which led me to adding the props, which then led me to adding some typescript. The typescript ended up taking quite a while, I was adding it correctly but it kept moving the dreaded red line issues into the parent element. This didn't feel quite right so I reset myself, did some research and realised I was not passing the props correctly. Once I fixed this error I had no more issues, I can now add as many cards as needed using the props and my imported types from my types file. The next issue is to figure out how to use the site diplay card again and again instead of coding it everytime.
