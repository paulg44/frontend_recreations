# frontend_recreations

This is a project I've wanted to start for a while. I will find sites I like (or don't) and recreate them to the best of my abilities, then improve on them as I see it. Inspiration from Youtube channel Hyperplex, who does a similar thing.

I've decided to do this project as I believe my skillset lies in frontend development, and this project will be a good way of expanding on that whilst learning other things I'm not fully comfortable with yet. Therefore I have decided to create this project in React, Typescript, it will be fully tested using Jest and Cypress. I'm sure there will be some minor backend functionality and some interactive elements. So all in all it should be a gfood all round project.
