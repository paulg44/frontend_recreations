## PLAN

1. Create Homepage
2. Create Container list for each different recreation & add to homepage
3. Create page "card" with different paths for each recreated page
   - Title
   - Preview Image
   - small description
4. Add each page card to Container (database? or self contained?)
   - Reacreated page
   - Restyled page
   - Recreated page is what shows first, restyled site hidden. Their will be a toggle switch to switch bewteen restyle & recreate pages
5. Figure out how to reuse DisplaySite Commponent!!
